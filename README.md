# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

This project is focused on predicting customer churn using various machine-learning classification algorithms. By identifying customers who are likely to leave a service, businesses can take proactive steps to improve retention.

## 🧠 Objective

To build, evaluate, and compare multiple classification models for churn prediction using a structured dataset of customer information.

## 📁 Project Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature encoding and transformation  
- Model training (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVC, Decision Tree, Random Forest)  
- Model evaluation using classification metrics  
- Confusion matrix visualization  
- Comparative analysis for model selection

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning

## 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset includes the following customer attributes:

- Demographics: `Gender`, `SeniorCitizen`, `Partner`, `Dependents`  
- Services: `PhoneService`, `MultipleLines`, `InternetService`, `OnlineSecurity`, etc.  
- Account Info: `Contract`, `PaperlessBilling`, `PaymentMethod`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`  
- Target Variable: `Churn`

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

3. Open the notebook in Jupyter or a compatible environment.
4. Follow the notebook cells to:
   - Preprocess the dataset
   - Train multiple models
   - Evaluate each model's performance
   - Compare results to choose the best model

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Each model is assessed using:

- **Accuracy**  
- **Precision**  
- **Recall**  
- **F1-Score**  
- **Confusion Matrix**

## 🏆 Best Model

After comparing all models based on the above metrics, the notebook highlights the most effective model for predicting churn.
